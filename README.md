## Project Overview

This project is divided into two main components: the frontend and backend.

### Frontend

The frontend is built using React.js, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It interacts with the backend API to fetch and update data dynamically. We use CSS for custom styling and Bootstrap for UI components to ensure a responsive and user-friendly interface.

### Backend

The backend is powered by Express.js and Node.js, providing a robust server-side infrastructure. It communicates with the PostgreSQL database to store and retrieve data related to reservations, facilities, and user accounts. Authentication and authorization mechanisms are implemented to secure the API endpoints.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React.js, CSS, Bootstrap
- **Backend:** Express.js, Node.js
